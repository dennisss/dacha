Automata Related Algorithms
===========================

- Currently mainly focused around representing state machines for regular languages

Included is:
- Representations for NFAs and DFAs
- Subset 
- Execution of a DFA over a given input 


The end binary of this is a program which takes as input a simple regular expression and a list of files and then compiles the expression and finds all matches to it in the given files
