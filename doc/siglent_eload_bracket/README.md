Bracket for mounting the Siglent SDL1020X-E (or similar model) underneath a desk. As this electronic load is abnormally long compared to other electronics heat, this saves lot's of desk space.

This bracket features 4 banana jacks to allow easier connection of loads and for easier access to the rear voltage sense terminals.

Print Settings:
- 0.2mm layers.
- 20% infill
- PETG
- No supports
    - But be sure the printing orientation is configured as specified below
    - Printing will require overhangs.

Printing:
- Print 3 of eload_corner_bracket.stl
    - Place the triangular face on the build surface
- Print 1 of eload_banana_bracket.stl
    - The flat surface with the banana plug holes should be placed on the build surface.

Installing:
1. Remove the existing rubber bumpers from the electronic load.
2. Attach the eload_corner_bracket.stl to 3 of the 4 top corners (all but the front right one) using the same screws used for the rubber bumpers.
    - Note: Be careful when inserting screws into the front side screw holes as these screw into internal nuts which aren't fixed in place and may fall out.
3. Install 11mm banana plugs into the holes of the eload_banana_bracket.stl piece as shown in the picture.
4. Secure the banana plugs from the back of the bracket with hot glue
5. Install the banana plug bracket to the electronic load using the previously removed screws
6. Re-insert any previously removed screws into remaining holes in the electronic load to prevent the case from sliding off.
7. Using 22 AWG solid core wire, attach the back of 2 banana plugs to the rear voltage sense terminals (in the picture, we use the green and blue ones).
8. Screw the electronic load to the bottom of a desk using #10-12 x 3/4 inch screws
    - It's recommended to first drill a 3mm pilot hole.
    - Positioning of the holes doesn't need to be exact as the brackets have some built in ability to move side to side.
