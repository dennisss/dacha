Controleo3 Profile  // This must be the first item in the file

// The name of this profile
Name "NC191LT50 Lead-free paste 165~C"
// The title is displayed in the top-left corner
Title "Reflow"
// Show a graph, including the liquidus temperature
Show graph to 200C for 600 seconds
Graph divider at 138
// The deviation (in Celsius) above which to abort
Deviation to abort 25C
// The maximum temperature.  If exceeded, reflow will abort and the oven door opened
Maximum temperature 200C
// Set a maximum duty cycle to avoid damage to your oven (bottom/top/boost)
Maximum duty 100/75/60


// Close the oven door if it isn't already
Close door over 1 second
// Turn the convection fan on
Convection fan on
// Turn the cooling fan off
Cooling fan off
// Stop the timer for now, until the temperature is above 50C
Stop timer
// Wait for the oven to cool to get consistent results
Display "Waiting for oven to cool to 50~C"
Wait until below 50C

// Start the reflow
Display "Phase: Pre-soak"
// Turn on elements for a short while to heat them up
Element duty cycle 80/60/30
Wait until above 50C


// The heating elements typically take some time to heat up, so it is best to
// zero-base the reflow to a higher temperature.  The graph in the datasheet shows
// 75C after 15 seconds, so that's what we do here
Initialize timer to 30 seconds
Start plotting at 30 seconds
// Select the heating bias (bottom/top/boost)
Bias 100/80/60
// Continue ramping up the temperature using PID
Ramp temperature to 90C in 60s

// Start the soak phase
Display "Phase: Soak"
// Select the heating bias (bottom/top/boost)
Bias 100/50/20
// Slow increase in temperature during soak
Ramp temperature to 130C in 120s

// Start the reflow phase
Display "Phase: Reflow (boost)"
// Force the elements on for a short while to get a quick increase in
// the temperature of the elements (bottom/top/boost)
// This will be limited by the "Maximum duty" command above
Element duty cycle 100/100/100
Wait for 10 seconds
Display "Phase: Reflow"
// Select the heating bias (bottom/top/boost)
Bias 100/80/60
// Ramp up the temperature for reflow
Ramp temperature to 138C in 30s

Ramp temperature to 160C in 30s

// Hold the temperature at peak for a few seconds
Display "Phase: Reflow (hold)"
// Maintain peak temperature for a short while
Maintain 165C for 10 seconds
// Stop the timer so we know how long the reflow took
Stop timer
// Turn the elements off now (bottom/top/boost)
Element duty cycle 0/0/0

// Start Cooling
Display "Phase: Cooling"
// Open the oven door
Open door over 10 seconds
// Wait for the door to open
Wait for 10 seconds
// Turn the cooling fan on
Cooling fan on
// Wait for the temperature to drop
Wait until below 100C

// Boards can be removed now
