Organizing electronics parts is a key challenge to development velocity:

Requirements:

- Must be able to enumerate all the parts I have
- Measure roughly how many I have
- Make it easy to add/remove inventory with barcodes.
- Trace-ability of components back to Mouser/Digikey/SparkFun/Adafruit with local mirroring of assets like datasheets
- Catalog where something is located
  - Specifically which bin each part is located.

Workflow for removing parts from bins:

- Specify the project (or a general workbench one)
- Scan a part's barcode
- Enter the number of items.

Integrating new parts

- Add documentation
- Connect with label maker to print out a label.

- This can generalize to a lot of different things.
- For large or through hole components, I don't need to keep them on a feeder as they will need manual attention anyway
